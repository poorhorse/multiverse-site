							<h2>Chieko Asakawa</h2>
							<p>(visual impairment) was born in Japan and became blind as a teenager. She has developed and continues to develop numerous technologies to assist people who are blind and visually impaired in using computers and accessing the internet. Her innovations in web accessibility, digital braille, and voice browsers are frequently used today. She currently works at IBM and is a professor at Carnegie Mellon University with research in the field of navigation for people with visual disabilities using artificial intelligence.

							<h2>Alexander Graham Bell</h2>
							<p>(Learning disability – most likely dyslexia)
								(1847-1922)
								
								Alexander Graham Bell, best known for inventing the telephone, was a brilliant inventor and educator who lived and worked in Boston, Massachusetts, for much of his life. His curiosity and creativity led him to make advancements in various fields, from communication to aviation. He founded the first telephone company, and his groundbreaking work revolutionized how people connect. Bell was also passionate about helping people with hearing impairments, spending much of his life working on methods to improve communication for the deaf community. His legacy of innovation continues to impact the world today.</p>

							<h2>Ralph Braun</h2>
							<p>(muscular dystrophy) (1940-2013) was born and raised in Indiana. Once his muscular dystrophy progressed to his needing to use a wheelchair for mobility, he created a powered scooter for himself and later retrofitted a jeep that he could drive his scooter into and then operate the jeep. The company he later started to adapt vehicles for wheelchair users remains one of the largest adaptive vehicle modification companies in the United States.</p>
